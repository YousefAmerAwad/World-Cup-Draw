# World Cup Draw

## How It Works
Teams are placed into four pots based on FIFA's rankings. Qatar were automatically put in Pot 1 as the host nation. One team per pot will be selected to make up the eight groups for the World Cup. <br>
There are a few caveats. No group can have two teams from any confederation, except for UEFA, since Europe will have 13 guaranteed berths. However, no group can have more than two UEFA teams.
